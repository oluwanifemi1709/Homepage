Website design using HTML and Inline CSS


This website is a training by me, to improve my knowledge on how to use various HTML tags and also Inline CSS. It's to show how much have learnt since the past four (4) days.


Various HTML tags suchs as h1 - h6, div, span,b, img, a, etc. 

Also css properties ranging from :
color -  used to change the color of a text 
background-color: This was used to give the container and its element a background-color
Font-  Used to change the font property, ranging from font-family, font-size, etc
text-decoration - Used to either add an underline, overline, line-through.





I have been able to learn a lot, and this project shows I can do much more bette in a little time.
